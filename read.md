For the past 8 years, I have been doing content creation, on Youtube, Twitch, and even my own site. But after much consideration, I will no longer be doing content creation. In the past 2 years, my passion for this stuff has completely been lost, and I no longer want to do this stuff. I will be pursuing my passion for coding and working on cool projects. You may see me show up in people's videos, you may see me go live everyone in a blue moon. In my time of doing this, I have reached milestones that are crazy and that I never thought I would reach, I have all of you to thank for that. You can catch me on Github doing some cool stuff. Thanks for the support love you all!
