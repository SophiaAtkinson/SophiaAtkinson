### All of the projects that I have worked on have always had a plan if everything goes to shit. This is Codsworths if it ever happens.

### If I shut Codsworth down it will go in this order.

- A Tweet will be sent out on Twitter, then the website home page will be changed to [this](https://codsworth.xyz/endoflife.html), A date will be given for shut down. Could be a week, or more.
- On the day of the shutdown another tweet, will be sent out, Then Codsworth will be pulled offline.
- After that, I will continue to pay for the domain, Just in case if it ever comes back.

### That is the whole plan.

### This does not mean it will happen any time soon.
